Step-by-Step Guide to Upload Photos and Add to Your Birthday Gallery

Step 1: Upload Photos to Imgur (Free Image Hosting)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Open your web browser and go to https://imgur.com/upload
2. Click on "Choose Photo/Video" and select the photos you want to upload from your computer.
3. Wait for the upload to complete.
4. After upload, click on each photo to open it.
5. Right-click on the photo and select "Open image in new tab" or "Copy image address" to get the direct URL of the image.
   - The URL should end with an image extension like .jpg, .png, etc.
6. Copy this direct image URL for each photo.

Step 2: Prepare URLs for Gallery
--------------------------------
For each photo, you need two URLs:
- Thumbnail URL (smaller size for grid view)
- Full-size URL (larger size for lightbox view)

If your hosting service does not provide different sizes, you can use the same URL for both.

Step 3: Update gallery-images.ts File
-------------------------------------
1. Open the file `client/src/data/gallery-images.ts` in your code editor.
2. Scroll to the section where new images can be added (look for entries with placeholder URLs like "YOUR_THUMBNAIL_URL_HERE_1").
3. Replace the placeholder URLs with your copied URLs.
4. Add a meaningful caption for each photo.

Example:
{
  id: 10,
  src: "https://i.imgur.com/your-thumbnail.jpg",
  fullSrc: "https://i.imgur.com/your-fullsize.jpg",
  caption: "Your caption here"
}

Step 4: Save and Test
---------------------
1. Save the file.
2. Run your project or refresh the gallery page.
3. Your new photos should appear in the gallery.

Additional Tips:
----------------
- Use similar aspect ratios for consistent gallery appearance.
- Keep captions short and meaningful.
- Test with one photo first before adding many.

If you want, I can help you update the gallery-images.ts file once you provide the URLs.

Happy photo adding!
